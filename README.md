# Covid Query

Data Exploration of a Covid Dataset in SQL
In this script I query a Covid 19 dataset, I was able to join the Infections and Vaccinations dataset highlighting information from different countries and cleaning the data into a presentable format. In the program, I display my skills in the use of joins, partitions, and creating views in SQL. I was able to dissect data on Total covid cases and the death percentages. I compared total deaths bs cases in places like Nigeria and Canada. Trying to understand the data I wanted to see if there was a link between deaths and the country's HDI.
